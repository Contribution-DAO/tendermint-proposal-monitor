# Data Directory

This directory contains JSON files used by the Proposal Monitor application to keep track of:

- Last checked proposal IDs (`last_checked_proposals.json`)
- Alerted proposals (`alerted_proposals.json`)
- Voting end alerted proposals (`voting_end_alerted_proposals.json`)

These files are generated and updated by the application during its runtime.
